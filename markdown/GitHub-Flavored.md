## Emoji! :grin:

Adding emojis is easy-peasy. :+1:  
Just enclose the emoji name in `: :`. Cheatsheet of emojis [here](http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).


## Simple Stuff - Styling text

> You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.

|Style|Syntax|Keyboard shortcut|Example|Output|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Bold           |`** **` or `__ __` | command/control + b | `**This is bold text**`                 |**This is bold text**                  |
|Italic         |`* *` or `_ _`     | command/control + i |`*This text is italicized*`              |*This text is italicized*              |
|Strikethrough  |`~~ ~~`            |                     |`~~This was mistaken text~~`             |~~This was mistaken text~~             |
|Bold and italic|`** **` and `_ _`  |                     |`**This text is _extremely_ important**` |**This text is _extremely_ important** |

## Checklists or Task Lists

> You can create task lists by prefacing list items with `[ ]`. To mark a task as complete, use `[x]`.
> Task lists render with checkboxes in all comments and Markdown files. Select or unselect the checkboxes to mark them as complete or incomplete.

In comments:

> You can reorder task lists by clicking to the left of a task's checkbox, dragging it to a new location, and dropping it. If you have multiple lists within a comment, you can reorder tasks across them. You can't add or reorder tasks in other comments.


```
- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request
```

Will render as:

- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request
