* `Additional modules (gems) can be installed by contacting HostGator via live chat, phone, or email to support@hostgator.com along with your account details.`

* `Currently, we are refusing Rails 2.3.8 upgrades on shared servers, since it is broken with Mongrel. A VPS or dedicated server would be required if you want Rails 2.3.8. We are waiting for a new version of Mongrel to come out before we make any further advancements.`

* `The above is a list of plugins (modules/gems) not actual executable programs. Some of these modules can be installed as programs, but only on dedicated servers, not on shared.`
