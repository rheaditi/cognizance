# Sublime Text 3

##  1. Emmet & PyV8 Issue
When you get errors stating automatic download of PyV8 is failing:

1. Go to [emmetio/pyv8-binaries](https://github.com/emmetio/pyv8-binaries) repository and get the binary for your operating system.
2. Extract and place the folder in your installed packages directory. Eg. `pyv8-win64-p3` folder for `Windows x64` will be placed in `%SUBLIMEDIRECTORY%/Installed Packages/PyV8/`  
  So the final path will be something like `...\Sublime Text 3\Installed Packages\PyV8\pyv8-win64-p3\PyV8.py` for some file in the directory.
  
Note: Find the installed packages using the `Browse Packages` command.
