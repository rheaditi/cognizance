remove [apt remove <name>]
   remove is identical to install except that packages are removed instead of installed. Note
   that removing a package leaves its configuration files on the system. If a plus sign is
   appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be
   installed instead of removed.

purge [apt remove <name>]
   purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged (any configuration
   files are deleted too).
